# diamond-square-maps

This is my first attempt at creating procedurally generated maps. The Diamond-Square algorithm is used to generate a height-map which is then used to create an image array in numpy which is finally saved as a .png file using opencv. To learn how to implement the algorithm this I followed the guide/tutorials at: https://jmecom.github.io/blog/2015/diamond-square/ and https://www.bluh.org/code-the-diamond-square-algorithm/. They were both extremely helpful and I learnt some interesting tricks when reading the latter.

To run this program you will need:
* Python 3
* opencv (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/opencv-python)
* and numpy (http://www.numpy.org/)
